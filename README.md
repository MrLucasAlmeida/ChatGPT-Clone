### ChatGPT Clone
Created a chat app that makes calls to Text Davinci 003 using [OpenAI Api](https://openai.com/api/). For your first prompt, it might take a good 10 seconds. Check out my project [HERE](https://chat-gpt-clone-mrlucasalmeida.vercel.app/)).

### Prompt Ideas
Ask it to explain something complicated.\
Ask it to write code.\
Ask it to tell you a joke.

### Example Prompts
Explain the HTTPS stack but do it like a cowboy from the old westerns.\
What are wormholes. Explain like I am 5.\
Give me party ideas for a birthday of a 29 year old.

### Hosting
Used Vercel for client side and Digital Ocean for server side hosting.\
[Vercel](https://vercel.com)\
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

### What I Learned
* How to create a chat style front end.
* How to fetch responses using OpenAI Api.
* Host both the client side and server side.
* Setup Https on a Ubuntu server.
